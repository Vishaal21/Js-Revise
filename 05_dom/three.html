    /*.innerHTML vs .createTextNode
    ***************************Rebuilding the Entire HTML Content" when using div.innerHTML **************

HTML Content Replacement: When you use div.innerHTML = ..., you're essentially telling the browser to replace all the content inside a <div> element with new content. This new content is specified as a string in the ... part.

DOM Structure: The content inside a web page is structured like a tree, with elements nested within other elements. This structure is called the DOM (Document Object Model). Each HTML element (like <div>, <p>, or <a>) is a part of this tree, with parent and child relationships.

Parsing and Recreating: When you replace the content of a <div> using innerHTML, the browser needs to do two main things:

Parsing: It must read and understand the new HTML content you provided in the .... This process is called parsing, where the browser figures out the structure of the new content.
Recreating: After understanding the new structure, the browser rebuilds the entire DOM structure within the <div>. It creates new nodes (like elements, text, etc.) based on the new HTML string.

******************On the other hand, the document.createTextNode and appendChild method is generally considered more efficient because it does the following:

Minimal DOM Manipulation:

Instead of replacing the entire content, this method adds a new text node as a child to the <div>. It doesn't involve recreating the entire DOM structure within the <div>.
Adding a single text node is a lightweight operation compared to rebuilding the DOM.
No HTML Parsing:

You're working with plain text content, so there's no need for the browser to parse and validate HTML. This can save processing time.
