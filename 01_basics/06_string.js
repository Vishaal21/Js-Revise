/*String when used without new keyword will be treated as primitive but when used with new keyword will be treated as object.

  String in js are treated as immutable object.

  This means that once a String object is created, its value cannot be changed. 
  If I try to modify a String object, a new String object with the modified value will be created instead. 

  When i call the toUpperCase() method on a String object, it returns a new String object with all the characters converted to uppercase, 
  rather than modifying the original String object in place.
